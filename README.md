# BruteSniffing fisher

<b>This repo is depricated, it will be replaced by its CLI version [BruteSniffing_Fisher-CLI](https://github.com/programmingAthlete/BruteSniffing_Fisher-CLI)</b>

## Introduction

Welcome to the ButeSniffing_Ficher, a multiplatform python hacking tool in a menu style.</br>

Launch the program by the command line by</br>

    python main.py

It allows you do to:

* Sniffing
* Zip-file Bruteforce
* Website attacks
    * Information gathering
    * Web Server Bruteforcing
    * Cloning
    * Fishing
* Crypto Analysis
    * RSA encryption schema
    * DGHV encryption schema with public key compression

At the moment only enrcyption and decryption by the two schemas are possible, mathematical attacks on RSA will come in
the further commits. ***The RSA encryption scheme does not work for big keys, this is because the key is stored in an
SQLite DB which cannot store such big integers. A fix for it will be applied in the next commits by using a session
variables or a temporary file as session storage***.

## Python version

The program has been developed using python3.6. However, no issue should occur with older 3. versions.

## Requirements Installation

Automatically checks for the presence of the required libraries and installs them if you consent it. If you don't
consent it, it shows you the command to perform the installation of the libraries. The libraries to install are read
from the Setup/requirements.txt file.

Libraries to install:

* requests
* urllib3
* BeautifulSoup
* ctypes
* netaddr
* python-nmap
* lxml
* crypto_pkg package for the cryptography ( still by me - https://github.com/programmingAthlete/crypto_pkg) - I am
  currently looking for a solution to use the SageMath library (crypto schemes and attack work well with it) and
  automatise its installation in python venvs - I think that docker is the solution.

## Structure

Hirerchy of the project:

* main.py
* Logs - exceptions logs
    * main.txt - exceptions raised from main.py
    * controller.txt - exceptions raised from controller.py
* Setup
    * setup.py - sets the python version, the menus to show, the unix-windows commands generalisation and Proxychains
      and Tor settings
    * check.py - checks on the required libraries
    * server.config - constant to set if using localhost (choose between MAMP , XAMPP aphache servers and apache2
      server)
    * menus.txt - file from which the menus are read. Edit here to add/remove menus
    * menu.py - python file to extract the menus into dictionaries from the 'menu.txt' file
* Includes
    * includes.py - some functions used by the modules
* modules - objects for the controller (navigator between menus) and the attacks. Edit here to add/remove features. Each
  attack should be a class with a run method to be reached by the core class.
* data - Where the cloned pages and the found credentials are stored - the relative directories will be created. A
  password list is also found in the BruteForce subdirectory.
* Server - code to put in the index.php file on the server for the fishing

You can add more menus by updating the file Setup/menus.txt - RESPECT THE FORMAT!!

You can add the corresponding features by updating the modules/Attack directory adding the file with the corresposiding
non-spaced name and the non-spaced uppersized first letter class name.

#### Example - add an Exploit

Add "Exploit Name" in the Setup/menu.txt file, create the exploitName.py file in the modules/Attack directory and
implement the ExplotName class containing a run() method.

## Proxychains and Tor

Proxychains and Tor are supported for Linux platforms. Edit the settings in the Setup/setup.py file

## Issues and Improvements

* Functionalities can be added 'menus' in the Setup/menus.txt file, modules in the modules directories and functions in
  the Includes/includes.py file.
* The server settings may be improved, the goal would be to make the fishing attack available using the default web
  server of a system
* In the fishing attack the python program waits for a tmp.txt file to be created by the php code, then deletes it. The
  process has to be slowed down for the python program to grab the tmp.txt file.
* The encryption schemes (mostly the RSA one) does not work for big keys, this is because the key is stored in an SQLite
  DB which cannot store such big integers. A solution will be applied by using a session variables or a temporary file
  as storage.
